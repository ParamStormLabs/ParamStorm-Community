   $ cd ParamStorm-Community
   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ParamStormLabs/ParamStorm-Community.git

2. Commit changes
    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m '<Your Commit Message>'
    ```
3. Update your local copy of upstream before pushing your updates
   ```
   $ git fetch upstream
   $ git rebase upstream/main
   ```
4. Push the branch
    ```
    $ git push origin <Your Branch Name>
    ```
    ‚ö†Ô∏è If you used to opened a pull request before, you will need to do force push with the `--force`.
5. Now go to your fork repository on your github account, and create Pull Request. After that please submit the changes for the project maintainers to review.

    It's alright if the maintainers requesting changes. It happens to almost everyone :)
